- Hello, I successfully completed my internship assignment at Flexmoney by developing a captivating project using the MERN stack. The project focuses on facilitating user registration for yoga classes through a well-designed admission form. Throughout the process, I gained valuable insights into various aspects, such as form validation, frontend-backend integration, and deploying web applications online.

- Here's a breakdown of my approach:
- **1. Frontend Development:**
- Created an aesthetically pleasing admission form using HTML, CSS, and ReactJS.
- Ensured the form's responsiveness across different devices to maintain a seamless user experience.
- 
- **2. Backend Development:**
- Implemented the backend functionality using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- Incorporated basic validations in alignment with the assignment requirements.

- **3. User Registration Flow:**
- Conducted essential validations to guarantee completeness and accuracy of user-provided information.
- Validated that the user's name is not empty.
- Set age constraints between 18 and 65 years.
- Ensured the user specified their gender.
- Validated the contact number to consist of 10 digits.
- Specified the fee amount to be exactly 500.
- Required users to select a slot before proceeding to payment.

- **4. Enhancements for Real-World Usage:**
- Implemented a "Payment Successful" message upon successful registration.
- Envisioned the potential for real-world application by suggesting the addition of a payment method, accommodating UPI or card payments.

- Overall, the project stands as a testament to my proficiency in full-stack development, showcasing skills in both frontend and backend technologies. The inclusion of a payment method would further enhance its practical utility in real-world scenarios.
